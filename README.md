# Project People Analytics with Tableau

## Project Description:

- Analysis of People Analytics using a Human Resources dataset with 311 employees to uncover workforce trends.
- Visualization created with Tableau to explore various aspects such as employee distribution, position-based salaries, satisfaction levels, and workload.

## Goals:

- Identify and visualize key workforce metrics, including distribution by gender, job position, and salary levels.
- Understand correlations between job roles, salary, and employee satisfaction to inform data-driven HR strategies.

## Insights and Dependencies:

- Key findings include Production Technician I as the most common position and the highest salary held by the President & CEO, despite lower satisfaction levels compared to other roles.
- Dependencies: Tableau for data visualization and Python libraries for any supplementary data analysis.

## Advice:

- High salary does not always align with job satisfaction, as seen with the President & CEO's role. Consider redistributing workload to reduce stress and enhance job satisfaction.
- Organizations should leverage data-driven approaches to balance employee well-being with performance and optimize human resource management.
